Here I will be uploading the different projects for my portfolio

WORK IN PROGRESS

State Interface (Vue 3.0, Javascript, Typescript, CSS, Astro, Vitest, Pinia)

State Interface is a basic responsive interface with a little bit of reactivity, where
astro is used for the rendering, Vue 3.0 + Typescript to manage the overall project,
I use pinia to have stores for store and state management across components
and everything has unit testing with vitest

Old Projects

Mumford And Sons, Studio Ghibli, Simple CSS Scrolling, Wonderbox (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP)

Old very basic projects done in HTML, CSS with a little bit of Javascript and PHP for forms.
