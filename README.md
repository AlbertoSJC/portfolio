Here I will be uploading the different projects for my portfolio


State Interface (Vue 3.0, Typescript, Astro, Vitest, vue-test-utils, pinia)
State Interface is a basic responsive interface with a little bit of reactivity, where
astro is used for the rendering, Vue 3.0 + Typescript to manage the overall project, 
I use pinia to have stores for the reactivity to be more easy to access across different components (do makes more sense in bigger projects)
and everything has unit testing with vitest and vue-test-util
